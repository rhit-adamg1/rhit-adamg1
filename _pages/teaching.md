### Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology

#### ME123 - Computer Programming
Software tools and engineering processes for mechanical engineers. Topics may include: structured programming (Matlab), simulation of rigid body motion, presentation software, and spreadsheets. Introduction to teaming and creativity.

#### EM103 - Introduction to Design
Introduces the engineering design process including problem definition, analysis, alternate solutions, specifications of final solution, and techniques of oral and written communications. Stresses the importance of teamwork through group design efforts.

#### ME327 - Numerical Methods of Engineering Analysis
This is an inter-disciplinary course focusing on the generation and interpretation of numerical solutions and the processing of numerical data for engineering problems. Topics include approximate solutions to nonlinear algebraic and differential equations, initial and boundary value problems, numerical integration and differentiation, optimization, data conditioning, and regression analysis. Trade-offs between accuracy and cost are emphasized. Matlab is used as the programming language.

#### ME430 - Mechatronic Systems
Applications of microprocessors and microcontrollers and digital electronics to the design and utilizations of embedded control systems in smart systems and products. Topics include Boolean logic and algebra, system hardware and software development, and interfacing for mechanical applications.

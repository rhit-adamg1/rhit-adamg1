Design, fabrication, and testing of a wireless magnetic microrobot capable of 2D micro-force sensing using standard photolithography and dry etching techniques. This microrobot is mostly used for biomedical applications, such as stiffness characterization of tissue phantoms and safe cell manipulation. 
This is a simple description of the $\mu$ FSMM project.
